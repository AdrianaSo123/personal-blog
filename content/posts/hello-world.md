## Why a Blog?

There's something different about writing publicly. It forces you to actually think through what you believe, not just hold a half-formed opinion and nod along with yourself in the shower.

This is my attempt to do that. To write things down. To be wrong in public, update my views, and occasionally say something that's actually useful to someone.

## What You'll Find Here

No single niche. I'm interested in too many things to pretend otherwise:

- **Software & engineering** — architecture, tools, the craft of building systems
- **Ideas & thinking** — mental models, books, how to think more clearly
- **Random dives** — whatever I'm obsessing over at any given moment

## The Format

Short or long, doesn't matter. If an idea is worth sharing, it gets a post. If it needs 3,000 words, it gets 3,000 words.

Thanks for being here. Let's get into it.
