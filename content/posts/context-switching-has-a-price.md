I used to think I was a good multitasker. Then I tracked how long it actually took me to get back into a problem after an interruption.

The answer was: longer than I wanted to admit.

## The Transition Cost

Every task switch has a transition cost. Time to close what you're doing, open the new thing, remember context, and get back to speed. Research puts this at anywhere from 5 to 23 minutes per interruption.

That sounds dramatic until you count how many times a day you get pulled away. Slack message. Email ping. Quick question. Browser tab. A thought.

In an 8-hour day of modest interruptions, you might have 2-3 hours of actual focused time. The rest is transition and warm-up.

## Why It Feels Productive

The cruel trick is that multitasking *feels* like productivity. Lots of movement, lots of responses, lots of open loops. It's stimulating. Your brain rewards you for the variety.

Deep work, by contrast, feels slow. You sit with a hard problem. Progress is invisible for long stretches. There's discomfort in the focus.

The feeling of productivity and actual output are not the same thing.

## What Actually Helps

A few things that have made a real difference:

**Time blocking that's actually defended.** Not "I'll try to focus" but "this block has no notifications, no Slack, no exceptions." Protecting it like a meeting.

**Batching shallow work.** Email at 10am and 4pm. Slack checks a few times a day. Not constantly.

**Written context.** Before ending a session, write one sentence: where you are and what the next step is. Future you won't have to reconstruct everything from scratch.

**Singular tabs.** One task, one browser window, as much as possible. Every open tab is an invitation to switch.

## The Honest Part

None of this is easy. The pull toward constant responsiveness is social — people expect quick replies, and there's a cost to being slow. Not every work environment gives you the freedom to go deep.

But even marginal improvements compound. Two more focused hours a day is a lot of work over a year.
