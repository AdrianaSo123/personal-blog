There's a specific kind of confidence that people have in their own thoughts. "I know what I think about this." And then they try to write it down, and discover that what they had was a feeling about a position, not the position itself.

Writing is the place where that distinction becomes unavoidable.

## The Difference Between Thinking and Writing

When ideas exist only in your head, they're slippery. You hold them at the angle that makes them look right. You gloss over the gaps. You assume your way through the hard parts without noticing.

The moment you write a sentence, it becomes falsifiable. You can read it back. You can ask: is this actually true? Does the next sentence follow from this one? Where's the evidence?

Writing forces a kind of rigor that internal monologue doesn't.

## What You Discover in the Gaps

The most useful thing that happens when I try to write something is discovering what I don't actually know.

I'll be explaining a concept and realize I can't get through the middle part. I thought I understood it, but I was pattern-matching to the shape of the idea rather than the idea itself. Writing makes that visible.

This is, incidentally, why explaining things to other people teaches you more than just studying. And why the rubber duck works.

## Notes vs. Writing

There's a difference between taking notes and writing. Notes are for retrieval — capturing something to find later. Writing is for understanding — working through something to see what's actually there.

Both are valuable. But a folder full of captured notes that you never write *from* is just a comfortable illusion of thinking.

## Low Stakes, High Value

The goal doesn't have to be publication. The value of writing isn't contingent on an audience. Some of the most useful writing I do is a paragraph I'll never show anyone — just working through a decision or an idea until I understand my own position.

You can start anywhere. Write one paragraph about something you think you believe. See if you still believe it when you're done.
