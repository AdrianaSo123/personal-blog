## We're All Broken Reasoners

Rolf Dobelli's *The Art of Thinking Clearly* is one of those books that should come with a warning label. Every chapter dismantles another cherished belief about your own rationality.

The good news: the biases are learnable. Once you can name them, you can (sometimes) catch them in the act.

## The Three That Actually Changed How I Think

### 1. Survivorship Bias

We only see the winners. The startups that failed, the books that flopped, the strategies that didn't work — they're invisible. This makes the past look more predictable than it was, and makes success look more learnable than it is.

Counter: always ask "where are the failures?"

### 2. The Sunk Cost Fallacy

We stay in bad situations because of what we've already invested. The money's gone. The time's gone. The only question is: is the future worth it?

Counter: ignore past costs when making forward-looking decisions.

### 3. Confirmation Bias

We seek information that confirms what we already believe and discard what challenges it. The internet makes this worse, not better.

Counter: actively seek out smart people who disagree with you.

## Worth Reading?

Yes — but in chunks. It's 99 short chapters, each on a different bias. Read a few at a time. Let them sink in. Apply them to your own recent decisions.

You'll be uncomfortable. That's the point.
