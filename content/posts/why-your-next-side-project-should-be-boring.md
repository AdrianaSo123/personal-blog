excerpt: "Exciting tech stacks feel good to start. Boring ones actually get finished."

Every developer has a graveyard. A folder somewhere called `~/projects` or `~/code` full of half-built things that once felt exciting. A Rust web framework. A GraphQL + Blockchain thing. A machine learning recommendation engine for your grocery list.

They die for the same reason: the tech was the project.

## The Seduction of the Shiny Stack

There's a specific kind of motivation that kicks in when you discover a new tool. It feels like momentum. You're learning fast, everything's a revelation, and for a few weekends you're unstoppable.

Then reality shows up. The docs are sparse. You hit an edge case the library doesn't handle. The Discord server is 200 people arguing about the roadmap. You realize you've spent two weeks and have no actual product.

## Boring is a Feature

When you pick tools you already know, something interesting happens: you actually think about what you're building instead of how you're building it.

Node.js is fine. Postgres is fine. A simple REST API is fine. These aren't exciting choices — that's exactly the point. When the infrastructure is invisible, the product becomes visible.

The engineers who ship consistently tend to have a boring stack and an interesting problem. The engineers who don't tend to have the inverse.

## What "Boring" Actually Means

Boring doesn't mean outdated or bad. It means:

- You've used it before and know where it hurts
- There's a decade of Stack Overflow answers
- It works at 3am when you're debugging and tired
- Your future self can read it six months later

## The Honest Test

Before you pick a tech stack for your next side project, ask: am I excited about building the product, or about building *with this*?

If it's the latter, that's fine — just be honest that you're doing a learning project, not a product. Learning projects are valuable. But don't confuse them with shipping.

Pick the boring stack. Ship the interesting thing.
